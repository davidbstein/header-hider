# header-hider

## Hide the header when the user is readin'

A very light-weight javascript plug in that finds the `<header>` on a page and hides in when the user scrolls down, but reveals it when the user scrolls up.

Works by setting a negative `margin-top` for the `<header>` when the use scrolls down and removing it when the user scrolls up.
